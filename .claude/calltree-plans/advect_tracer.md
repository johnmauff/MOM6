# Call-tree conversion plan: `advect_tracer`

Promoted mid-survey from a candidate descendant of `step_MOM_tracer_dyn` to its own entry point
(user decision): `advect_tracer` is `public` in `MOM_tracer_advect` and called from 4 places
across 2 files (`MOM.F90`'s `step_MOM_tracer_dyn` and `step_offline`, plus
`MOM_offline_main.F90`'s `offline_advection_ale`/`offline_advection_layer`) — a stronger
externally-fixed contract than `step_MOM_tracer_dyn` itself had, and this is what resolves the
shared-descendant problem cleanly: every caller, in or out of any campaign tree, treats
`advect_tracer` as an opaque call needing only call-site marshalling. `step_MOM_tracer_dyn`'s own
plan (deferred, not yet written) will list this call the same way.

No pre-existing audit doc existed for this entry point.

## Hard precondition checks

- **Callers (repo-wide, confirmed by grep):** `MOM.F90:1645` (`step_MOM_tracer_dyn`),
  `MOM.F90` (`step_offline`, via the same call graph found for `tracer_hordiff` below),
  `MOM_offline_main.F90:336,517,558,938,955` (`offline_advection_ale`,
  `offline_advection_layer`). None of these callers are campaign entry points; this plan does not
  touch them — only `advect_tracer`'s own signature and everything below it.
- Shared-descendant check on `advect_tracer`'s own descendants: `advect_x` (430-823) and
  `advect_y` (827-1248) are both **private** (`MOM_tracer_advect`'s `public` list is only
  `advect_tracer`, `tracer_advect_init`, `tracer_advect_end`) — confirmed zero callers outside
  this file. Fully tree-internal, no joint-decision flag needed.
- Not entry points, out of scope: `tracer_advect_init`, `tracer_advect_end` (same
  init/teardown-pair pattern excluded everywhere else this session).

## Step 1d — wrapper case

**Case 3** — plain subroutine, called directly, no existing alias/wrapper.
`advect_tracer` → `advect_tracer_TR`, new `advect_tracer` wrapper. Wrapper never bridged.
`advect_x`/`advect_y` are not entry points, no rename/wrapper of their own.

## External signature (frozen — do not change)

`advect_tracer(h_end, uhtr, vhtr, OBC, dt, G, GV, US, CS, Reg, x_first_in, vol_prev, max_iter_in, update_vol_prev, uhr_out, vhr_out)`
— `MOM_tracer_advect.F90:57-91`. 10 mandatory dummies (`h_end`, `uhtr`, `vhtr`, `OBC`, `dt`, `G`,
`GV`, `US`, `CS`, `Reg`) + 6 optional (`x_first_in` logical, `vol_prev` real 3-D array,
`max_iter_in` integer, `update_vol_prev` logical, `uhr_out`/`vhr_out` real 3-D arrays). The doc
comments call out `vol_prev`/`max_iter_in`/`update_vol_prev`/`uhr_out`/`vhr_out` as "only used in
offline tracer mode" — i.e. these six optionals are exactly the seam between the online
(`step_MOM_tracer_dyn`) and offline (`MOM_offline_main.F90`) call sites.

## Full descendant list

| Subroutine | Direct in-tree callees | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `advect_x` (430-823) | none | private leaf; called from `advect_tracer` at 4 sites depending on `x_first`/iteration parity |
| `advect_y` (827-1248) | none | private leaf; same calling pattern |

Both leaves take `Tr` (the `tracer_type` array, see below), `hprev`/`uhr` or `vhr`, a
neglect-threshold array, `OBC`, a `domore_u`/`domore_v` logical array, `ntr`, `Idt`, loop-bound
scalars, `G`/`GV`/`US`, and an `advect_schemes` integer array. No calls to anything outside this
file — no EOS, no halo-pass calls of their own (halo passes happen in `advect_tracer`'s own body,
around the leaf calls, via `create_group_pass`/`do_group_pass`).

## `OBC` — grows the union substantially (see `shared_type_unions.md`)

`advect_tracer`/`advect_x`/`advect_y` dereference `OBC` far more deeply than any prior tree,
including a **new field shape not seen before**: `segment(n)%tr_Reg`, a pointer to a full nested
`tracer_registry_type` (itself containing its own `Tr(:)` array of `tracer_type`, with fields
`ntr_index`, `tres`, `OBC_inflow_conc` dereferenced, plus a `ntseg` count) — a registry nested
inside a segment nested inside the array-of-struct `segment(:)`. This compounds the existing
"array-of-custom-derived-type decomposition" open item (`shared_type_unions.md`) rather than
resolving it — flagged, not solved, here.

New top-level fields beyond what's already unioned: `open_u_BCs_exist_globally`,
`open_v_BCs_exist_globally` (siblings of the already-unioned `specified_*_BCs_exist_globally`),
`exterior_OBC_bug` (scalar logical). New per-segment field: `segment(:)%HI%jsd`, `segment(:)%HI%jed`
(plain, non-B-grid — the existing union rows only had `JsdB`/`isd`/`ied`/`IedB`/`JedB`). Already-
unioned fields reused without change: `OBC_pe`, `number_of_segments`, `specified_u_BCs_exist_globally`,
`specified_v_BCs_exist_globally`, `segment(:)%is_E_or_W`, `segment(:)%is_N_or_S`,
`segment(:)%specified`, `segment(:)%direction`, `segment(:)%HI%IsdB`/`IedB`/`JsdB`/`JedB`,
`segnum_u`, `segnum_v` (the last two already known from `vertvisc_coef`'s top-level-array shape).

## `tracer_type`/`tracer_registry_type` (`Reg`/`Tr`) — new type, array-of-struct, hand-authored gap

Not yet in `shared_type_unions.md` — first tree to need it. `tracer_registry_type%Tr` is a
**fixed-size** array (`Tr(MAX_FIELDS_)`, not allocatable) of `tracer_type`, ~40 fields per
element; `advect_tracer`/`advect_x`/`advect_y` touch only 7: `t`, `ad_x`, `ad_y`, `ad2d_x`,
`ad2d_y`, `advection_xy` (all real pointer arrays, 2-D or 3-D), `advect_scheme` (integer scalar).
Same shape as the already-flagged `BTCL_u`/`BTCL_v` (`btstep.md`) and `OBC%segment`
(`shared_type_unions.md`) situation — needs the same per-field, hand-authored container
decomposition; no sibling skill covers array-of-custom-derived-type natively. `tracer_registry_type`
is shared 45 files repo-wide (broader than `OBC`'s 44) — candidate for promotion to
`shared_type_unions.md` once a second tree needs it (expected: `tracer_hordiff`, surveyed
separately, also takes `Reg`).

## `tracer_advect_CS` — bundle by precedent (no fresh Step 3 needed)

6 fields (`MOM_tracer_advect.F90:36-45`, private): `dt` (real), `diag` (nested `diag_ctrl`
pointer), `debug`/`useHuynhStencilBug` (logical), `pass_uhr_vhr_t_hprev` (`group_pass_type` —
halo-exchange infra), `default_advect_scheme` (integer). Same shape as every other private CS
bundled this session — `create_config_bundle_type` on the 4 physics scalars (`dt`, `debug`,
`useHuynhStencilBug`, `default_advect_scheme`), excluding `diag` (nested CS pointer, opaque by
precedent) and `pass_uhr_vhr_t_hprev` (infra type, leave alone by precedent — same treatment as
`pass_var`/`pass_vector` themselves).

## Step 2 — target classification (fixed-rule items)

| Target | Classification | Skill | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `h_end`, `uhtr`, `vhtr` | mandatory raw array dummies | `convert_array_containers` | Standard 3-D real arrays. |
| `vol_prev`, `uhr_out`, `vhr_out` | optional raw array dummies | `convert_present_to_associated`, after containerizing | Offline-mode-only outputs; never leave raw given this tree is scheduled for Phase 3 bridging. |
| `x_first_in`, `max_iter_in`, `update_vol_prev` | optional scalars | `convert_present_to_associated` | logical/integer/logical. |
| `domore_u`, `domore_v` (in `advect_x`/`advect_y`) | mandatory raw **logical** array dummies | `convert_array_containers` | `LogicalArray_t` confirmed to exist in `array_container_lessons` alongside `RealArray_t`/`IntArray_t` (confirmed during `tracer_hordiff`'s survey, which hit the same shape in `find_neutral_surface_positions_discontinuous`/`mark_unstable_cells`) — ordinary classification, no gap. |
| `advect_schemes` (in `advect_x`/`advect_y`) | mandatory raw integer array dummy | `convert_array_containers` | Standard `IntArray_t`. |
| `OBC` | shared, union (grows substantially — see above) | `create_shadow_container_type`, union scope | See `shared_type_unions.md`. |
| `Reg`/`Tr` | shared, new type, array-of-struct | hand-authored decomposition (no sibling skill) | See dedicated section above. |
| `G`, `GV`, `US` | shared grid/scaling types | `convert_array_containers`'s own drop mechanism | Not a separate decision. |
| `CS` (`tracer_advect_CS`) | private, 6 fields | `create_config_bundle_type`, physics-fields-only | See dedicated section above. |

## Phase 2 execution order

1. **TreeRoot split** — `advect_tracer` → `advect_tracer_TR` + wrapper (Step 1d).
2. **`create_shadow_container_type`** — `OBC`'s type definition and `Reg`/`Tr`'s hand-authored
   decomposition are both built once by the combined shared-infrastructure PR
   (`shared_type_unions.md`), not here — the `Reg`/`Tr` decomposition specifically is shared with
   `tracer_hordiff`, authored once, not duplicated across the two plans. This stage's own work is
   just the wrapper-side glue — instantiate each shadow from `advect_tracer_TR`'s own dummies,
   use it, copy back.
3. **`create_config_bundle_type`** — `tracer_advect_CS`, once.
4. **Optional-array containerization** — `vol_prev`, `uhr_out`, `vhr_out`: containerize first
   (item 5 below), then `convert_present_to_associated` (item 8) — never left raw, this tree is
   scheduled for Phase 3.
5. **`convert_array_containers` — downward pass**, root to leaves (`advect_tracer_TR` →
   `advect_x`/`advect_y`). Resolve the logical-array open item before this step touches
   `domore_u`/`domore_v`.
6. **`convert_array_containers` — upward pass**, `G`/`GV`/`US`-drop decisions.
7. **`convert_locals_to_containers`** — `hprev`, `uhr`, `vhr`, `uh_neglect`, `vh_neglect`,
   `local_advect_scheme`, etc., once dummies are stable.
8. **`convert_present_to_associated`** — the 6 optional dummies, ahead of Phase 3.
9. **`hoist_container_marshalling`**, once, at `advect_tracer_TR`.

## Phase 3 wave order

- **Wave 1** (leaves): `advect_x`, `advect_y`.
- **Wave 2 (root, last)**: `advect_tracer_TR`.

Wrapper (`advect_tracer`) never bridged.

## Branch

`claude_advect_tracer_calltree`, created once before Phase 2 Stage 1.
